A project inspired by an Udemy course: Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2023 Edition].

## About
Meals is an application where you can pick some food recipes, sorted by categories (eg: Italian food, Chinese food). Also, you can sort them again by other 4 criteria (gluten-free, lactose-free, vegetarian, and vegan food) and you can remove or add some recipes to the favorites section.
